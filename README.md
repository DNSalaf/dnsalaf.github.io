# Welcome to my GitHub Pages (alafSantos.github.io)
This repository was created to host some personal project, and currently I've uploaded here my personal page containing my CVs and resumes in different languages.

For the design of the mentioned personal page, I used Vue.js and Quasar framework.

Feel free to read my resumes and propose me projects that you might be developing and think I could help or work together.
